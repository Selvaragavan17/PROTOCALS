Slide 3 — What is a Watchdog Timer? (expanded)
Slide content (bullets):
•	A hardware timer that continuously monitors system health by expecting periodic “kick” signals from the software.
•	If the software fails to issue a kick in time, the WDT first issues a warning (interrupt) and then, on continued failure, resets the system automatically.
•	It acts independently from application code — protecting the system even if the software hangs.
•	Common in safety-critical & always-on systems to maintain availability and recover from faults without human intervention.
Presenter note:
Explain the independence property: because the WDT is hardware-based, it can catch software faults that software-based checks may miss.
________________________________________
Slide 4 — Need for a Watchdog Timer (why)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Detects and recovers from software hangs, infinite loops, deadlocks, and driver failures.
•	Minimizes downtime by automatically restoring a known-good state.
•	Adds robustness to systems where remote or unattended operation is required (IoT, automotive, medical).
•	Helps meet safety and reliability requirements in product specs and certifications.
Presenter note:
Use a short story (e.g., remote weather station that must reboot itself when network stack crashes) to make it concrete.

Slide 5 — Key Features (overview)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Heartbeat / Kick mechanism to confirm liveness
•	Two-step recovery: interrupt then reset
•	APB register interface for software control and monitoring
•	24-bit prescaler for wide timeout range
•	Programmable registers for flexible configuration
•	Optional safety unlock and suspend-mode support
Presenter note:
Briefly mention that each feature will be examined in detail in later slides.
________________________________________
Slide 6 — System Monitoring (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	The CPU (or supervising task) must send periodic kicks before timer expires.
•	Kick frequency and timeout are programmable to match application needs.
•	Kicks can be single-cycle pulses or register writes depending on implementation.
•	Missing the kick is interpreted as the software failing to make progress.
Presenter note:
Point out tradeoffs: very short timeout increases sensitivity (more false resets), very long timeout delays recovery.
________________________________________
Slide 7 — Interrupt and Reset Generation (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	On first missed timeout: WDT asserts an interrupt to notify software — allows diagnostics or graceful shutdown.
•	If software still fails to recover and misses the second timeout: WDT asserts reset to bring the system to a known state.
•	Reset duration is configurable; interrupt can be a pulse or level-tied to a status bit.
•	Two-step approach helps avoid unnecessary full resets and preserves debug info.
Presenter note:
Emphasize that an interrupt gives the software a chance for last-second recovery or to log error info.
________________________________________
Slide 8 — APB Interface Support (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•  Inputs: paddr[15:0], psel, penable, pwrite, pwdata[31:0], pclk, presetn
•  Outputs: prdata[31:0], pready, pslverr
•  Writes: no wait states; Slave asserts csr_wr_en and pready=1
•  Reads: Slave asserts csr_rd_en, waits for csr_rd_vld before pready=1 (wait cycles inserted)
Presenter note:
Mention that APB is deliberately simple — suitable for peripherals like WDT in an SoC.
________________________________________
Slide 9 — 24-bit Prescaler (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Prescaler divides the core clock to produce slower pulses for timer counting.
•	With 24 bits, very long timeout ranges are possible without huge timers.
•	Prescaler_value determines how many core clock cycles generate one timer decrement (count_en pulse).
•	Prescaler gives coarse/fine control: set prescaler + timer duration for precise timeouts.
Presenter note:
Give an example: with 50 MHz clock, prescaler can convert it to 1 Hz ticks depending on value — explain how this extends timer range.
________________________________________
Slide 10 — Programmable Registers (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Software-configurable registers include:
o	WDT enable/disable
o	Timeout duration (timer reload value)
o	Prescaler value
o	Reset duration
o	Status & clear bits for interrupts/resets
•	Safe update rule: disable WDT before changing timing-critical fields to avoid transient behavior.
•	Optional read-back registers provide runtime telemetry (current counter value, prescalar count).
Presenter note:
Recommend a typical register map layout and note the importance of atomic writes for certain fields (e.g., unlock patterns).
________________________________________
Slide 11 — Safety Pattern Unlock (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Optional safety mechanism requires writing a specific unlock code before enabling/disabling the WDT.
•	Prevents accidental changes by buggy software or spurious writes.
•	Typical sequence: write UNLOCK code → write configuration → write ENABLE.
•	Hardware rejects mis-ordered or incorrect unlock sequences.
Presenter note:
Explain that unlock reduces risk during firmware updates or autorun scripts.
________________________________________
Slide 12 — Suspend Mode Support (feature detail)
Slide content (bullets):
•	In low-power modes the WDT can either:
o	Pause completely (no countdown), or
o	Run at reduced rate (slow tick) depending on system policy.
•	Choice depends on whether the watchdog must still protect while suspended (e.g., critical safety systems) or conserve battery.
•	Status bits indicate whether the WDT was active during suspend.
Presenter note:
Point out design decision: always-running WDT may cause unwanted resets during long sleep periods unless software handles kicks properly.
________________________________________
Slide 13 — Design Overview (block-level)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Main blocks:
o	APB Slave → receives register ops
o	CSR → stores control & status registers, handles CDC
o	Prescaler → creates count_en pulses
o	Timer → 32-bit down counter
o	Control FSM → decides interrupt/reset behavior
o	Reset generator → shapes reset pulse to host
•	Data flow: APB commands → CSR → core logic (timer/prescaler) → FSM → intr/reset outputs
Presenter note:
If you have a diagram, show it while explaining each block’s role in one pass.
________________________________________
Slide 14 — Interface Signals (detailed)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Core signals:
o	clk_core — core clock input
o	rst_n — async active-low reset
o	intr — interrupt output to CPU
o	reset — reset output to system
•	APB signals:
o	pclk, presetn, paddr, psel, penable, pwrite, pwdata, prdata, pready, pslverr
•	CSR handshake signals: csr_wr_en, csr_rd_en, csr_rd_vld, csr_wr_data, csr_rd_data
•	Synchronizers used for crossing pclk <-> core_clk domains for status reads/writes
Presenter note:
Highlight which signals are edgesensitive vs level-sensitive and which require synchronization.
________________________________________
Slide 15 — Timing Diagrams (healthy/missed/reset)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Healthy: kicks arrive before timer hits zero → no intr, no reset
•	Miss once: timer reaches zero → FSM issues intr, timer may be reloaded or kept — system can recover
•	Miss twice: second timeout without kick → FSM asserts reset for reset_duration
•	Diagrams show relative positions of kick, intr, reset signals over time
Presenter note:
Walk through sample timing with numeric timeouts (e.g., 500 ms timeout, 1st intr at 500 ms, reset at 1000 ms if no kick).
________________________________________
Slide 16 — Control FSM (detailed)
Slide content (bullets):
•	FSM monitors signals: wdt_en, kick, timeout, reset_completed
•	Actions:
o	When enabled: enter WAIT_KICK_1
o	On first timeout and no kick: assert intr, transition to WAIT_KICK_2
o	On second timeout and no kick: assert reset and enter WAIT_RESET
o	After reset completes, clear internal state and go to IDLE
•	Reset duration is programmable; FSM drives reset generator accordingly
Presenter note:
You can show pseudocode/state-transition table so hardware designers see exact behavior.
________________________________________
Slide 17 — FSM State Table & Encoding
Slide content (bullets):
•	States:
o	IDLE (2’b00) — disabled or after reset
o	WAIT_KICK_1 (2’b01) — waiting for kick
o	WAIT_KICK_2 (2’b10) — warning issued
o	WAIT_RESET (2’b11) — reset active
•	Transition conditions:
o	IDLE → WAIT_KICK_1: wdt_en = 1
o	WAIT_KICK_1 → WAIT_KICK_2: timeout && !kick
o	WAIT_KICK_2 → WAIT_KICK_1: kick
o	WAIT_KICK_2 → WAIT_RESET: timeout && !kick
o	WAIT_RESET → IDLE: reset_completed
Presenter note:
Mention how encoded states map to registers for ease of debug/trace.
________________________________________
Slide 18 — CSR & Clock-Domain Crossing (CDC)
Slide content (bullets):
•	CPu/APB side uses pclk domain — writes control registers.
•	Core logic (timer, prescaler, FSM) uses core_clk domain — updates status.
•	CSR performs:
o	Synchronizers for single-bit control/status crossing
o	Multi-stage handshake (rd_en_sync_1/2/3) for reads
o	Acknowledge paths for read latency and pready signaling
•	Safe CDC avoids metastability and lost requests.
Presenter note:
Explain read example step-by-step: CPU asserts read, CSR synchronizes to core, core samples and returns data, CSR signals pready.
________________________________________
Slide 19 — APB Read / Write Examples (practical)
Slide content (bullets):
•	Write example: set prescaler + timeout + enable
1.	Write prescaler_value
2.	Write timeout_duration
3.	Write unlock sequence (if enabled)
4.	Write wdt_enable = 1
•	Read example: check current_timer & intr status
o	CPU initiates read, APB slave asserts csr_rd_en, waits for csr_rd_vld, prdata returns value
•	Note: disable WDT before changing time-critical registers to avoid transient wrong behavior
Presenter note:
Recommend code snippet in firmware: disable → write → enable; also show how to clear an interrupt status bit.
